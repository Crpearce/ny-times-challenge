# NY Times News Reader Take-Home Challenge

## Abstract
This project was an 8 hour timed coding challenge designed to pull articles from the NYT top stories API, and providing a user a list of articles, a detailed view of each article, a link to the real NYT article, as well as a sort/filter/search functionality.  This challenge was given to demonstrate a strong understanding of React JS and FE best practices and an ability to prioritize for an MVP due to the time limit.

## Setup
1. Clone down this repo. Since you don't want to name your project "webpack-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
2. Remove the default remote: `git remote rm origin` (notice that `git remote -v` not gives you back nothing)
3. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of `[what you want to name the repo]` to be consistent with naming
4. Copy the address that you would use to clone down this repo - something like `git@github.com:...`
5. Add this remote to your cloned down repo: `git remote add origin [address you copied in the previous step]` - do not include the brackets

Now try to commit something (just add a line in the README) and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.

## Project Specs
- A list of articles
- A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
- Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort
